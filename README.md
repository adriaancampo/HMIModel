# An analytical model of full-field displacement and strain induced by amplitude-modulated focused ultrasound in harmonic motion imaging

## Description: 

Disease processes often induce microstructural alterations in tissues, resulting in changes to the mechanical properties of the corresponding biological structures. Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI) emerges as a pivotal elasticity imaging technique adept at investigating the mechanical parameters of tissues. By detecting tissue responses to an oscillatory acoustic radiation force, HMI enables exploration of displacement, strain, and Shear Wave Velocity (SWV). This code demonstrates an analytical HMI model, facilitating swift and precise computations of these mechanical parameters within a homogenous linear elastic material. The model offers valuable insights into underlying biomechanical dynamics, with applications extending to diverse scenarios, including tumor detection, characterization, and the monitoring of ablation procedures.

## Usage:

- Modify parameters and settings as needed.
- Run the script to execute the simulations.

## Output:

The code generates displacement and strain field components as matrices, representing the simulated spatial distribution.
